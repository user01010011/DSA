// Write a function which takes two numbers and return their sum.

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words? 
    // - "implement addition" or "implement adding two numbers"
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem? 
    // - integers? floats/floating points? How large are these numbers going to be? What about string for really large numbers? 
    // - Are we only working with 2 inputs? Is it always 2? What if someone wants to add 4, 10 numbers, is it valid to add 10 numbers together mathematically as our function only going to work with 2 numbers?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? 
    //  - integer? float? string? 
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
    // - Do we have enough information? What happens if someone only passes one number? Then we don't have enough information to do addition at that point. 
    // - If/when we don't have enough information, do we use 0 or do we return undefined or null or something? Or ignore it all together? What do we do? 
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
    // - maybe name the function Add2Nums, num1 and num2 are the arguments, and sum is the result that we return.
